# Collaboration Policy

- All changes must come in a PR
- All changes must be reviewed by another Collaborator or member of
  @nodejs/build
  - Small changes to the lookup table can be made without following the above
    process
- Changes can be landed in any way you prefer as long as it lands on the head of
  master with no merge commit
